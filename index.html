                                <p>Ysabel Kristine Oplida Alindogan was born on April 20, 2004 in Irosin District Hospital. She was the daughter of Mr. Alonzo Guarin Alindogan and Russel Hapita Alindogan. They currently living at Barangay Aroroy, Juban, Sorsogon purok 2. Ysabel was a girl who loved stories, especially books from Wattpad. The stories about love, adventure, and things that couldn't happen in real life was her favourite to read. She also loved to watch anime, those cartoons from Japan. She liked the pretty colors, the exciting stories, and the characters who made her feel happy or sad. They describe Ysabel as a kind and caring person. She always wanted to help others and make them feel good. Also according to them she was a good friend who listened to her friends when they had problems. When someone ask for help she was always there to help if someone needed it. Even though she had many friends she loved dearly, she wasn't really fan of going out . She preferred staying in her room, reading or watching something. Ysabel or mostly known as Tintin was the third of five children in her family. She had two older brothers, and being the only girl, she was very close to her dad. They shared a special bond. Most of all, Tintin cherished her family so much. She was a loving daughter who always tried to make her parents happy, helped out around the house and always showed them how much she cared. She didn't like seeing her family argue because it made her sad and down. Ysabel learned that stories and people are both really important. The stories she read and the characters she watched in anime helped her to be a better person. They taught her to be kind, to help others, and to believe in good things. She liked to share her love for stories with others and make them happy. Ysabel was a quiet girl, but she had a big heart. She loved her family, her friends, and the stories that made her feel alive. She was happy to spend her time reading, watching anime, and being with the people she loved. She knew that even though the world could be a difficult place, there was always beauty and kindness to be found, both in the stories she loved and in the people around her. She dreamed of writing her own stories someday, stories that would make people feel the same way that the stories she loved made her feel. She wanted to share her love for stories with the world and show everyone that even in the real world, there was still magic to be found. <a href="https://templatemo.com" target="_blank">TemplateMo</a>.

                                        <p>What is Plagiarism? Many people think of plagiarism as copying another's work or borrowing someone else's original ideas. But terms like "copying" and "borrowing" can disguise the seriousness of the offense: According to the Merriam-Webster online dictionary, to "plagiarize" means: -to steal and pass off (the ideas or words of another) as one's own -to use (another's production) without crediting the source -to commit literary theft -to present as new and original an idea or product derived from an existing source In other words, plagiarism is an act of fraud. It involves both stealing someone else's work and lying about it afterward. But can words and ideas really be stolen? According to U.S. law, the answer is yes. The expression of original ideas is considered intellectual property and is protected by copyright laws, just like original inventions. Almost all forms of expression fall under copyright protection as long as they are recorded in some way (such as a book or a computer file). All of the following are considered plagiarism: turning in someone else's work as your own copying words or ideas from someone else without giving credit failing to put a quotation in quotation marks giving incorrect information about the source of a quotation changing words but copying the sentence structure of a source without giving credit copying so many words or ideas from a source that it makes up the majority of your work, whether you give credit or not (see our section on "fair use" rules) Most cases of plagiarism can be avoided, however, by citing sources. Simply acknowledging that certain material has been borrowed and providing your audience with the information necessary to find that source is usually enough to prevent plagiarism. See our section on citation for more information on how to cite sources properly. What about images, videos, and music? Using an image, video or piece of music in a work you have produced without receiving proper permission or providing appropriate citation is plagiarism. The following activities are very common in todayâ€™s society. Despite their popularity, they still count as plagiarism. Copying media (especially images) from other websites to paste them into your own papers or websites. Making a video using footage from othersâ€™ videos or using copyrighted music as part of the soundtrack. Performing another personâ€™s copyrighted music (i.e., playing a cover). Composing a piece of music that borrows heavily from another composition. Certainly, these media pose situations in which it can be challenging to determine whether or not the copyrights of a work are being violated. For example: A photograph or scan of a copyrighted image (for example: using a photograph of a book cover to represent that book on oneâ€™s website) Recording audio or video in which copyrighted music or video is playing in the background. Re-creating a visual work in the same medium. (for example: shooting a photograph that uses the same composition and subject matter as someone elseâ€™s photograph) Re-creating a visual work in a different medium (for example: making a painting that closely resembles another personâ€™s photograph). Re-mixing or altering copyrighted images, video or audio, even if done so in an original way. The legality of these situations, and others, would be dependent upon the intent and context within which they are produced. The two safest approaches to take in regards to these situations is: 1) Avoid them altogether or 2) Confirm the worksâ€™ usage permissions and cite them properly..</p>
